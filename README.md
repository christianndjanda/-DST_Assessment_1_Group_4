## Project Members:
* Christian
* Inmran
* Katherine
* Shrey

## Reading and requirements
To install all the Python dependencies, listed in `requirements.txt`, use the following command in a virtual environment:

```{r}
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

All report content is in the directory:
* report

The report consists of the exploration of 4 different base models that are then stacked to make a combined overall model. The reading order is below:
* 01-K Nearest Neighbours Model.ipynb
* 02-logitistic_reg_model.ipynb
* 03-Decision Tree- Tuning parameters.ipynb
* 04-SVM_MODEL.ipynb
* 05-Stacked code.ipynb
* 06-Wrapup

## Evidence
Our working is shown in our own directories
- ChristianN
- ShreyS
- ImranV
- KatherineW

 
All 4 members worked individually on the base models and then these were combined into the stacked model.
